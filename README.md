# Windows Memory Cleaner
This is a simple RAM cleaner. There are times when programs do not release the memory they used, making the machine slow, but you donâ€™t want to restart the system to get the used memory back. This is where you use Windows Memory Cleaner to clean your memory, so you can carry on working without wasting time restarting your Windows.

# How it works
It frees up the memory in 4 different ways:

- **Empty Working Sets** - Removes memory from all user-mode and system working sets and moves it to the Standby or Modified page lists. Note that by the time, processes that run any code will necessarily populate their working sets to do so.
- **Empty System Working Set** - Removes memory from the system cache working set.
- **Empty Modified Page List** - Flushes memory from the Modified page list, writing unsaved data to disk and moving the pages to the Standby list.
- **Empty Standby List** - Discards pages from all Standby lists, and moves them to the Free list.
